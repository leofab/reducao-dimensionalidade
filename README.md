# Grayscale Image Conversion in Python

This project demonstrates how to convert an RGB image into a grayscale image and optionally into a black-and-white (binary) image, using only Python. The resulting image is displayed directly in Google Colab.


1. Convert RGB to Grayscale:
- Apply the luminosity method to compute grayscale values from RGB channels.
- Output a 2D array representing the grayscale image.

2. Black-and-White Conversion:
- Use thresholding to create a binary image (values are either black or white).
- The threshold is customizable.

3. Display Images in Google Colab.
